# wifi-geolocate-experiment

Source code from my lightning talk: a quick example how one can get a precise location and address of someone's computer, Chromecast or Google Home device (only macOS is implemented now).

## How to run
1. `git clone`
2. `yarn`
3. rename keys.json.example to keys.json, fill in your Google API key
4. `node src/index.js`
